# Electron LetsMove

A module that offers to automatically move your Electron app to the Applications
folder if opened from another location. Inspired by [LetsMove](https://github.com/potionfactory/LetsMove) for MacOS.

## Requirements

This module is designed to be used within Electron on macOS, it can be included in a cross platform Electron app and is a no-op on the Windows and Linux platforms.


## Installation

`npm install --save electron-lets-move`


## Usage

You should call the `moveToApplications` method as soon as possible after the app
ready event in the main process. Ideally before the user has any chance to interact
with the application.

`moveToApplications` returns a promise that will resolve when the application is
in the correct location, the user asked not to move or an error occurred. You can
also provide an optional node-style callback as the only parameter.


### ES5
```javascript
const {app} = require('electron');
const {moveToApplications} = require('electron-lets-move');

app.on('ready', function() {
  moveToApplications(function(err) {
    if (err) {
      // log error, something went wrong whilst moving the app.
    }

    // do the rest of your application startup
  });
});
```

### ES6
```javascript
import {app} from 'electron';
import {moveToApplications} from 'electron-lets-move';

app.on('ready', async () => {
  try {
    await moveToApplications();
  } catch (err) {
    // log error, something went wrong whilst moving the app.
  }

  // do the rest of your application startup
});
```
